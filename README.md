Get Going Grid
==============

__An incredibly simple and lightweight mobile first grid.__

To use the grid you will need a parent element with a class of `grid`. Columns are then implemented by using a class equal to the desired percentage width (`col-{width}`).

The available widths are:

* 100
* 80
* 75
* 70
* 66
* 60
* 50
* 40
* 33
* 30
* 25
* 20
