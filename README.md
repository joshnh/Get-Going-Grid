Get Going Grid
==============

__An incredibly simple, lightweight and responsive, mobile first grid.__

To use the grid you will need a parent element with a class of `grid`. Columns are then implemented by using a class equal to the desired percentage width (`col-{width}`).

The available widths are:

| Width | Class |
|-------|-------|
| 20%  | `.col-20` |
| 25%  | `.col-25` |
| 30%  | `.col-30` |
| 33.3%  | `.col-33` |
| 40%  | `.col-40` |
| 50%  | `.col-50` |
| 60%  | `.col-60` |
| 66.6%  | `.col-66` |
| 70%  | `.col-70` |
| 75%  | `.col-75` |
| 80%  | `.col-80` |
| 100%  | `.col-100` |

_Note: make sure that you are using the `grid` and `col-{width}` classes on block level elements._
